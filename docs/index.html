        <p class="lead">WiFi/Check is a simple app that displays information about the WiFi connections
        made from your Mac.  In the upgrade from Big Sur to Monterrey, Apple changed the
        permissions on the data file - so it now requires a password to access and any
        modifications to the file will require a password to make the change.  This also
        uses the command line utility <code class="small">networksetup</code> for reading preferred order
        and to remove a WiFi network from the list and if you want to see the password for
        the WiFi Network stored in your Keychain, it will prompt for a password there, too.

        <b>FAQ</b>

    <div class="row p-2">
        <b>Should I trust an app I download from the internet?</b>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <p>You should be skeptical of anything you download from some relatively unknown
            location. The app has been notarized by Apple - which is not a guarantee
            that it is "safe", but it means at least Apple has run it through whatever
            "app checker" they have and didn't create any red flags. If the app requires
            you to disable security for any reason (or the hashes above don't match what you downloaded), you have the wrong app.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <b>Yeah, I'm not typing in my password in some random app I download.</b>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <p>
            Smart! I wouldn't put my password into any app I just downloaded either.
            If you're on Big Sur, you don't need to.  Apple change the permissions of the
            known networks file in Monterrey that requires your password to access, specifically:<br/>
            <code>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.wifi.known-networks.plist</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is read and some of the data displayed is taken from this file.  If you are on
            Monterrey and don't want to enter the password, you can open Terminal, and change the
            permissions on the file yourself (that's all the app does) like this:<br/>
            <code>sudo chmod 644 /Library/Preferences/com.apple.wifi.known-networks.plist</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            There used to be a bunch more interesting information in this file but it seems
            each release of macOS is getting rid of details, so not sure how much longer the
            information will remain useful.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <b>Woah! You also want a password to show me my WiFi password?</b>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <p>
            Yes.  However, if you want to find this information yourself, this can also
            be found by opening the <code>Keychain Access</code> app from your
            <code>/Applications/Utilities</code> folder, searching for your WiFi network
            name, selecting the item in the list, clicking on the "Show password" checkbox...
            Anyway, this was more of convenience, and it uses the Apple supplied Keychain APIs,
            so up to you.
        </p>

    <div class="row p-2">
        <b>What does "Remove WiFi" acutally do?  Will this delete my WiFi?</b>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <p>
            No.  This removes the WiFi entry from your saved list of "known networks".  If you
            remove the WiFi you will have to rejoin that WiFi just like you did the first
            time.  Worst case scenario.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <b>Why would I bother removing the WiFi?</b>
    </div>
    <div class="row p-2">
        <p>
            I personally don't like keeping WiFi network information for networks I really
            don't use on a regular basis. Especially if you keep "open" networks (aka no passwords) around.
            If somebody decides to spoof an open network in a coffee shop, you just might
            join a network you don't expect to. Not a problem for most people, but keeping
            your approved "known networks" list to a limited set is a personal preference.
        </p>
        <p>
           You can also remove old WiFi connections outside the context of the app.  If you go into
           your <code>System Settings</code> (or Preferences, depending on what version of macOS you're running), select
           <code>Networks</code>, <code>Wi-Fi</code>, then click <code>Advanced...</code> you'll see a list of "Known Networks".
           This should be the same list you see in the WiFi/Check app.  You can remove
           items from the list here.  The app uses the command line <code>networksetup</code> to remove the network.
